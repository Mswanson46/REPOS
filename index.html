    <section><article id="about-me"><h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
<p> My name is Molly Swanson and I am a recent college graduate from the University
  of Minnesota with a degree in Mathematics. During my time in college, I obtained about
  three extra years of retail experience as well as one year working in the IT department
  for the University. I also obtained two years of retail experience before I attended college.
  During my time off from school in the summer, I worked at Target Field as a commissary porter in the warehouse of
  the stadium. This past summer I worked as an engineering technician intern for a company
  called NTI where we tested construction materials such as concrete and soil.</p>
  <p>It was definitely a difficult time deciding what I wanted to major in when I was in college.
    When I first came to the University of Minnesota, I thought I wanted to major in accounting.
    I quickly realized that the choice I had made was not the right one. In the period of deciding
    what I wanted to do, I decided next to major in animal science becuase of the love I have for
    companion animals. During the summer when I realized that I was not excited for my classes at
    all, I wanted to go a different path. I then decided I wanted to major in aerospace engineering because
    I found the idea of designing airplanes incredible. After a year of taking classes pertaining to the
    major, I quickly found out that physics was not my strong suit but Mathematics was.<span style="background-color: lightgreen; border: thick dashed orange;"> So I decided
    Mathematics was going to be my major of choice.</span> Ever since then, I have enjoyed every minute of it. College
    was definitely a whirlwind experience but I know that every decision I made was just apart of the journey.</p></article>
  <article id="Past-Experiences"> <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
<p>While I was working at NTI, there were defitnitely times where I was unsure of myself
and intimidated by my fellow interns. As the days and weeks went on I eventually became very
comfortable and confident in where I was at. During our time at NTI, all of the interns had to
take a certification test to be able to work for NTI. This test was to show contractors and
job supervisors that we were certified in testing concrete and that we were knew what we were doing.
They sprung this test on us 24 hours after we had learned all the content and it was a bit nerve wracking
just because there was little time we had to study. <span style="background-color: lightblue; border: thin solid darkblue;"">Just in a matter of 24 hours I was concrete certified
otherwise known as ACI certified.</span> This was a big accomplishment for me because everything was so new to me
and passing this test meant I could go out and do my job and that was something I was proud of.
</p>
<p>During my first season at Target Field, I had no idea what I was doing. I was confused about the product I was
  dispersing as well as the locations that needed to be restocked. It took me a while before I finally got a grip on
  what I needed to do and accomplish when I went to work. At the end of each month, each department names an employee
  of the month and at the end of my first month at Target Field it was me. I was shocked and excited because I was not
  expecting it at all. I knew I had worked as hard as I could have to be the best I could be but being employee of the month
  my first month was an expectation that I had not thought of. This not only boosted my confidence to work harder but to
  also learn as much as I could every time I went to work.</p></article>
  <article id="Hobbies">  <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
    <p>During my time in college, there were many opportunities to take up different activites and hobbies.
  One in particular that caught my attention right away was rock climbing. I started climbing during
  freshman year and ever since then, I fell in love. After graduating college, climbing didn't stop. I
  loved it too much to give it up. It was one of those activites where you can never get enough because as you
continue to improve the more fun it gets. Climbing is something I will never give up and I encourage everyone
to give it a try. </p>
  <p>As well as climbing, spending time doing fun activities with my friends and family
  is also part of my main free time. Whether it's watching television with friends and family or going out, I
  always have a great time. I love surrounding myself with good positive people. I also try to run as much as I
  can to stay in shape. I started running when I was a sophomore in college. It was a hard hobby to pick up because
  everytime I ran, I wanted to give up. It never seemed to get better which made it harder to keep doing it. As I stuck with
  it though it continued to get easier run farther and faster. Now I try to participate in as many races as I can because
  racing is one of the most fun atmospheres to be in. I believe that people aren't born to run. I think anyone can do
  it as long as they stick with it and keep their mindset focused while they're doing it.</p></article></section>
